# Cerebra
Cerebra is a DeSci project designed to enable the private analysis of research data from multiple parties. 

We have concentrated on a use case where data is collected via a computer-brain interface device as subjects interact with Eliza. 

This data is stored locally and subsequently uploaded to MPC nodes after all subjects have completed the experiment. 

The project employs TACEO co-SNARKs to analyse the data, and the results are stored on Aztec. 

This methodology ensures that researchers have verifiable proof that the results are derived from the correct datasets, that the analysis was conducted accurately, and that the privacy of the participants is maintained throughout the process.
